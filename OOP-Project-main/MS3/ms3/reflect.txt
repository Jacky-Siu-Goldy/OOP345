There are some feature of ms3 that is extremely confusing and I felt were unnecessary done to  complicate
things such as the instance variable m_cntCustomerOrder in the LineManager Module. The module never explain
where that total number of CustomerOrder objects going to come from. It took me days to realize that you get it 
by doing this:
for (auto it = pending.begin(); it != pending.end(); ++it) {
	m_cntCustomerOrder += it->getm_cntItem();
}
and getm_cntItem() is a function that i have to create on my own to return m_cntItem.

The function attemptToMoveOrder() is another confusing one. It returns a bool but for what is not explain.
I finish MS3 without any thing requiring attemptToMoveOrder() to return a bool. The only thing that I 
think return a bool for that function is good for is debugging or that it is to stop m_order from poping when
m_order is empty(). Those are the two things that I find causing undue stress to me, because it was not explained
why they are necessary, how it is done.
