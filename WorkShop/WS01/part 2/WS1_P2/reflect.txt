// I have done all the coding by myself and only copied the code that my professor provided to complete my workshops and assignments.

The difference between internal linkage and external linkage, is that a variable 
that is declare and defined to have an internal linkage is only visible to the 
linker within the translation unit it is present at, while an object or function 
that has an external linkage is visible to the linker when processing other 
translational unit.
When a variable is declare as static inside a function, memory is allocated for it for the
lifetime of the program. The memory is allocated once and it survive the end of the 
scope of the function so the value of the variable in the previous call get 
carried through to the next call. This is useful in application where previous state of the function
needs to be stored.
In the Event class display function, I used the static keyword to create an internal linkage for
a variable name counter. The counter is set to increment by 1 every time the display function is called.
Static variable in class is shared by objects. Since it is shared there cannot be multiple copies of the same
static variable. This is the reason why static class variable cannot be initialized in a constructor.
The changes that I made in upgrading my Event class included add an Event class copy constructor
and copy assignment operator. Also change class member description to a dynamically allocated char variable
